    ### Setting up your FAQ Bot
    
    1. **Upload documents**: Use this utility to upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files containing information your bot should use.
    
    2. **Run the main app**: Go to the main app to start asking questions in any language.
    
    3. **Important notes**:
       - The bot works best with well-structured documents
       - Upload documents in any language (German, English, etc.)
       - You can ask questions in any language, regardless of the document language
       - The more specific your questions, the better the answers
